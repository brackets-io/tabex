# TabEx
TabEx is an extension for Brackets that allows the user to exit (), {}, or [] by pressing the tab key. TabEx is
especially usefull when autocomplete is turned on. TabEx will only "jump" outside of (), {}, or [] when the cursor
is positioned within those characters, and will place the cursor after the inner-most nested pair. Press tab again
to "jump" out of the next pair.

# Usage
Load through Brackets Extension Manager.

To start using TabEx, select Use TabEx from the Navigation menu or press Ctrl-Shift-X. Repeat this process to turn TabEx 
off and use the editor in normal mode.
